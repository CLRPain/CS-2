Simon Says Rubric:
_____ Start button 5
_____ Continuous play/ success detection 10
_____ Flash Timing 15
Longer sequence should begin flashing after 1 sec of player successfully completing
previous sequence
Flashing buttons should be 0.5 sec flash (depressed)
So each color/button should take 0.5 sec being lit. Also wait approx 0.25s between
flashes so same button flashed multiple times can be observed.
_____ Sequence should not change 10
Sequence should be the same as before only add one new button(color) to the end
Sequence should start with 1 button and increase by one on each successful completio_____ Error Detection 15
Error press should be detected immediately and not at the end of sequence
Error if wrong button is pressed. Game over.
Error if player does not press any buttons for 5 sec. Game over.
