lol pickle
d = {} dictionary with shit in it

with open("filename", "wb") as f:
	pickle.dump(d,f) dumping the dictionary into the file because f is the file open function
wb for writebinary
or f=open("filename", "wb")
but if you do this way you have to f.close so you know im doing the with open one



rb is read binary

with open("filename", "rb") as f:
	e = pickle.load(f)
	
	
or
f = open("filename","rb")
e = pickle.load(f)
f.close()

NOW THIS WORK FOR FILES ONLY


for sockets and server communcation and stuff, you change a bit:
instead of pickle.dump(d, f)

you do data = pickle.dumps(D) since then connection is already established you only need to specify the data you want to send
