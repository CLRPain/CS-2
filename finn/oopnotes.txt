initializer is called constructer in c++

def __init__(self): #(double underscore on both sides)
dont have to use self as the argument but people will hate you if you dont

you can do A = thing()

thing is the init call and a is the argument in place of self

when they say method of the class they are talking about the funtions in a class

when you define a class, you can also def Classthing1(Classthing2) to inherit all the stuff you already wrote from the other one so you dont have to write it again

parent class and base class are the same thing its the other class that the child / sub inherits from

a function call for an instance in classthing2 will override the function with the same name in classthing (the parent)
